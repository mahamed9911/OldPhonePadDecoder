OldPhonePadDecoder ðŸ“±ðŸ”¤

Welcome to the OldPhonePadDecoder, a fun and nostalgic way to simulate decoding text from an old mobile phone keypad, often known as T9 text input! ðŸš€

This C# program takes a sequence of keypresses made on a classic phone's keypad (numbers, spaces, and backspaces) and decodes it into the text you wouldâ€™ve seen on those old-school mobile phones. Each key is mapped to a set of letters, and the number of key presses determines which letter is selected. For example, pressing '2' once gives 'A', twice gives 'B', and so on. You can even use spaces to separate words and backspaces ('*') to correct any mistakes. The input must end with "#" to mark the end of the sequence.

âœ¨ Features:

Decodes keypress sequences into text, like "4433555 555666#" to "HELLO"
Handles backspaces ('*') to delete characters
Supports space (' ') for separating words
Great for simulating the old mobile texting experience!
Try it out and relive the good old days of texting on T9! ðŸ˜Ž
